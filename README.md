# inf211 - Algorithms and Programming I
Hi there! Welcome to my Github repository for the Algorithms and Programming I course that I completed at Gebze Technical University. I'm excited to share my coursework and assignments with you!

Throughout the course, we covered a wide range of topics such as branching and iteration, string manipulation, functions, recursion, object-oriented programming, and much more. I've organized the repository into different folders, with each folder corresponding to a topic that we covered in the course.

The code files, documentation, and notes that I've included in each folder are well-commented and easy to follow. I wanted to make sure that anyone who visits the repository can easily understand my thought process and approach to problem-solving.

To ensure that my code is working correctly, I've included test cases and debugging files in each folder. I believe that these files will be helpful for anyone who wants to check my work and see how I tackled different problems throughout the course.

Overall, this repository is a reflection of my hard work and dedication to learning Python programming and problem-solving skills. I hope that it can be a helpful resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about the Algorithms and Programming I course at Gebze Technical University.
